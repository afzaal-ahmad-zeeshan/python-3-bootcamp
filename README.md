# Python 3 Bootcamp

Python 3 Bootcamp for everyone. :muscle:

> We do not expect you to have any computer science background at all!

## What

The aim for this bootcamp is to be a 2 month long event with 8 sessions. The
sessions will cover and focus on the Python as a programming language, and
not the computer science tool (think of it as an interview skill, etc.).

## Why

The aim of this bootcamp is to help everyone (especially non computer science
folks) to learn Python language. Thus, they would be able to use the same
concepts in their own tasks.

Think of the engineers, medical personnel, auditors, data entry professional,
and how Python can help them automate their tasks.

Python is a skill that won't hurt to have it. :heart:

## Where

The bootcamp happens on [my Twitch channel](https://twitch.tv/afzaalahmadzeeshan)
and you can join for free; *but I would appreciate if you can join and subscribe
to my channel there*. :pray:

> The live stream starts every Sunday @ 4pm Pakistan Standard Time.

## When

We are doing the bootcamp session every weekend on Sundays.
